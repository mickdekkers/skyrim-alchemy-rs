- [x] parse savegame (thanks @Jupp56!)
- [ ] extract player inventory from savegame
- [x] get game plugin load order
- [x] read all loaded game plugins (.esp, .esm, .esl) in mod load order
- [x] extract ingredient items from loaded game plugins
- [x] ~cache ingredient items and their effects to disk (invalidate if load order changes, game plugins are added/removed/modified)~ not necessary, it reads all the game data in around a second with a load order of >300 mods
- [ ] match player inventory to known ingredient items
- [ ] look at https://github.com/cguebert/SkyrimAlchemyHelper for potion recommendation algorithm
- [ ] OPTIONAL: somehow read from game save which ingredient effects are already known by player (and which are not), then limit data to that
- [ ] OPTIONAL: look at (relevant) container inventory contents too, in addition to player inventory
